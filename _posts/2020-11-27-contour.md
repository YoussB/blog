title: Contour Soup

Bear with me while I explore Contour

Here's the premise that I am building on:
- I know Kubernetes pretty well as an operator, hence I know my way around.
- I am familiar with the concept of serverless programming, but haven't done anything similar
  before.
- I am running my project on top of a GKE cluster.

**so .. here we go**

## What is Contour?
- Envoy inside ðŸ¤¯
- Wait ... What is envoy?

## What is Envoy?
- tl;dr open source edge and service proxy
- From the docs:
  - Envoy is a self contained process that is designed to run alongside every application server.
    All of the Envoys form a transparent communication mesh in which each application sends and
    receives messages to and from localhost and is unaware of the network topology.
- This seems to me like enough info to move on, will see if I will need to know more.

## OK, back to Contour:
- Contour is an open source Kubernetes [ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) providing the control plane for the Envoy
  edge and service proxy.
