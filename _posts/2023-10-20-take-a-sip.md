I have recently come across `sips` which is MacOS terminal built-in image processing tool. It is very useful to crop or resize images on the fly without having to use, God forbid, tools like Photoshop, or any UI. 

*How Cool is that!*

## Syntax

`sips [query/modification] file`

## Nice usages

Here's our test subject. The website's avatar.

![avatar](../images/avatar.png)

In order to get some data about the image, we use:

`sips -g all image`

This will give all the available info about the image. Here's the output:

```
  pixelWidth: 709
  pixelHeight: 709
  typeIdentifier: public.png
  format: png
  formatOptions: default
  dpiWidth: 72.000
  dpiHeight: 72.000
  samplesPerPixel: 3
  bitsPerSample: 8
  hasAlpha: no
  space: RGB
```

Now let's resize the image: 

`sips -o name -z [H] [W] image`

- Here, I use `-o` in order to output to a different file.
- This will resize the image to the given width and height. Make sure to use the correct aspect ratio though.
- The below is the output of using [H]=320 and [W]=320.

`sips -c [H] [W] image`

This will crop the image to the required width and height. The offset of the crop here is 0.

`sips -c [H] [W] --cropOffset [Y] [X] image`

This will crop the image to the set [H]eight and [W]idth but with an offset of [Y] vertically and [X] horizontally.

Here's the output of using `sips -o output -c 500 500 --cropOffset 104.5 104.5 image`

**P.S.** I am using 104.5 in order to keep the avatar in the middle of the image. Since the image is `709*709px`, this means that I need to offset my crop by `(709-500)/2` in order to keep the same composition.
