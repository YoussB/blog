Here is a list of all the devices that could be used for the smart home service offering. I have also stated how the system should be architected.

## Devices to consider:

- Doorbell with (or without Camera)
- Door lock with Bluetooth, fingerprint, or passcode
- Switches
  - One way
  - Three-way
  - Dimmer
- Gateway
  - Any device that could have computing power
  - Raspberry pi 4 or 5 should be sufficient
- Security:
  - Door Sensors
  - Cameras
  - Vibration detectors
  - window sensors
  - Control Hub
- Fire and CO Alarm
- Plugs
- Light bulbs
- Speakers
- Thermostat
- Humidity and temperature sensors
- Irrigation
- Curtains
- Flood and water detectors
- Able to integrate with smart appliances

## System:

- Home Assistant Server
- Home Bridge Server (for apple users)
- Voice activated device and Helper Screen
  - Google home
  - Amazon Alexa
  - Apple Homepod
- NO-IP or any DNS service to allow remote access

## Caveats:

- Need to make sure devices are compatible with either zigbee or matter
- Sales Options:
  - Implement and pay full price -> no support
  - Implement and pay to own the equipment, monthly fee for support
  - Rent the equipment, pay monthly to keep running

## Next Steps:

- Create a basic module and pricing
- Contact Potential Contractors to get requirements, or contracts
- Decide which devices are part of the main offering and which devices are extra
- Find suppliers for the main devices, and options for extra devices
- Create a website with services and portfolio
- Create a blog to showcase expertise and add some articles
- Start thinking about other marketing streams
