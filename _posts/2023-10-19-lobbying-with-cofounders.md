title: lobbying with co-founders
---

Recently I have come across the idea of lobbying/connecting with some startup founders in order to either work with them, or become a partner.

Follow my journey...

My usual go to is to start by asking ChatGPT to start gathering some ideas.

Here's my prompt:

```
what is the best way to lobby with startup founders to convince them that I could be a potential co-founder?
```

Below is the response, as well as my comments and thought process.


### Lobbying to be a co-founder isn't like lobbying in the political sense. Instead, it's about demonstrating value, building trust, and aligning visions. If you believe you could be a potential co-founder for a startup, here are steps and strategies to help you make your case:

1. **Self-Assessment**: Before approaching anyone, be clear about what you bring to the table. What are your strengths, experiences, and skill sets that the startup needs? How can you fill the gaps?

2. **Build Relationships**: Engage with founders in various settings â€“ attend startup events, join relevant communities, participate in workshops, and contribute to discussions. Over time, aim to have one-on-one meetings with founders to understand their vision and challenges.

3. **Demonstrate Value**: Before pitching yourself as a co-founder, consider working on a project or task that's valuable to the startup. Whether it's a pilot, a proof-of-concept, or some market research, showing your value through action can be compelling.

4. **Align Visions**: It's essential that you share a similar vision for the startup's future. Spend time discussing the business model, growth strategies, and cultural values to ensure there's a match.

5. **Show Commitment**: Startups require dedication. Be ready to demonstrate that you're committed to the long haul, whether that means putting in late hours, making personal sacrifices, or even investing your own money.

6. **Highlight Complementary Skills**: If the founder is a technical expert, but you have a knack for sales and marketing, emphasize this fit. Founders often look for co-founders who can bring in complementary skills.

7. **Provide References**: Offer contacts who can vouch for your expertise, dedication, and past performance. Positive testimonials from credible individuals can boost your case.

8. **Discuss Equity and Roles**: Be transparent about what you expect in terms of equity, role, and responsibilities. However, approach this topic with sensitivity. It's a delicate matter that requires negotiation and mutual respect.

9. **Be Genuine**: Don't oversell yourself or make promises you can't keep. Founders appreciate authenticity. Show genuine interest in the startup's mission and how you can contribute to its success.

10. **Prepare for Rejections**: Not every pitch will be successful. Some founders might already have co-founders or might not see a fit. It's essential to handle rejections gracefully and learn from feedback.

Remember, becoming a co-founder is as much about personal fit and trust as it is about skills and experience. The chemistry between founders is vital for the startup's long-term success. Be patient, persistent, and always be ready to demonstrate your worth.

### Maybe, if I answer these questions into the next prompt ChatGPT could help me formulate a generic message to send to potential "partners"

1. **Self-Assessment**:
  - I am technology enthusiast, with tons of expertise in the cloud.
  - I am passionate about learning new technologies everyday.
  - having worked closely with lots of startups before, from consulting to being a full-time CTO, I am very familiar with how startups operate, the dos and don'ts and how to build a healthy tech team.
  - Before leading my current team, I was an engineer at VMware, and Dell, where I worked on kubernetes, clouf CI/CD and a lot of enterprise projects. This means that not only am I a good leader, but also I am a veteraned engineer.
  - I have lead multi-disciplinary teams including data science, front-end, mobile platforms (IOS & Android), backend, and infrastructure. I also love to work on backends, infrastructure, and automation.
  - My leadership style combines transformational leadership and servant leadership. I love to lead by example, while making sure that the business is growing through a common vision and a motivated team.

2. **Show Commitment**:
