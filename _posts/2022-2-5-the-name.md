title: What's in the name?
---

**Here are some of the facts why I chose the name CloudChowder, maybe it will help you understand how I think and either interest you or repel you from my blog.**

## Cloud you said...

I am a software engineer by education and by experience. Cloud has been my focus since 2016. I joined EMC as a software engineer with only knowledge about C# desktop and limited knowledge about cloud computing, docker, etc. 

Throughout my 5.5 years tenure within the Dell Technologies family (EMC, Pivotal, VMware) I have gotten more and more interested in the cloud and how things work and run in a computing world that is almost entirely on the cloud.

I now run a technology team at Mytigate that is responsible for developing, deploying, monitoring, and maintaining a cloud-based software as a service product. 

This short journey has taught me a lot about the cloud and made it the main focus of my current career.

## What is a Chowder?

Chowder is a rich, creamy soup that often contains clams and potatoes. New England clam chowder is the most famous. Other seafood chowders skip the clams and swap in scallops, shrimp, lobster, crab, or even fish like cod or smoked salmon.

While soups can be thin and light, chowder is characterized by being rich and thick. Regardless of the ingredients used, chowder is always chunky, and most variations are creamy.

I hope this kinda gives an idea as to...

## Why CluoudChowder then?

I hope the last paragraphs gave you an idea of how weird my mind is set up. I have a career centered around cloud engineering which is a thick and dense field and has a ton of different tools, platforms, infrastructures, etc. This made the cloud to traditional software like the chowder to soup.. get it?

**Other mildly interesting, but true reasons I chose the name:**

- it was available, hehe: to find a nice name that is available in 2021 was almost impossible. Once I found this, I clung to it
- Pun intended: CloudChowder was, for me at least, a clear pun on the clam chowder. I love puns, I'll take it.

choosing this name might not have been the most rational decision one can do, but to be honest most of my decisions are random and in many cases irrational but have proved to make my life very interesting so far. 

**P.S. if you made it so far reading this weird article about choosing a name for my website and blog, I believe we might be like-minded, so continue reading on. You may find some interesting stuff here.**

**P.S.2 if you read the first couple of lines then scrolled to the bottom in boredom, I am sorry I wasn't able to get your attention. I promise the blog will contain more interesting stuff for you. Come on go check it out**
